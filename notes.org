test_os

* Notes

This project is following [[https://os.phil-opp.com/][this tutorial.]]

** Building
To build, we need to use "xbuild", a crate installed from "cargo-xbuild".
We will be automatically targeting our custom json file from configuration set in the ".cargo/config" file, so we simply need to use "xbuild" instead of build.
Additionally, we have set our runner to use bootloader and bootimage, and the xtester.
(setq cargo-process--command-run "xrun")
(setq cargo-process--command-build "xbuild")
(setq cargo-process--command-test "xtest")
** Rust Nightly
We will use rustup to install the nightly compiler. We will manage this by using
"rustup override add nightly"
This will allow us to use the nightly compiler in this directory.
